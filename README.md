Firefox Redirect Checker
=============================

Extension for displaying the redirect chain (if any) for a page request in Firefox. It is heavily based on the [“Redirect Path”](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/redirect-path/aomidfkchockcldhbkggjokdkkebmdll) extension for Chrome built by Ayma.
